Improve GenericInputForm (client side) to better build arbitrary json structures:
 * add ability to enter json for any parameter and have it sent as an object
 * add ability to force numbers to be actual numbers
 * add ability to have fields eval'd client side (so you can enter, for instance, Math.PI)
 * make input form use color syntax editor (or, at least some of the stuff from snippet editor so it does indenting etc better)

Have output toggle between text area and "pretty output", rather than "show line numbers"

test framework:
 ability to specify (in html file) a different callback for the response, (or additional one) beyond showing it as json

Snippet editor: 
 use new json post stuff to make snippet editor work without requiring php

 system to send down snippet editor code as a single js file (currently a php program)

Bookmarklet for test framework
 so it does UI testing (etc)

Client js built into test framework?? (needs discussion)

Security: username password, saved in cookie, but sent in json (rather than as cookie, which may not work cross domain), settable and clearable
